// Constants
let pi = 3.14159

// Uncommenting the following line would cause an error to be thrown
// pi = 3

// String Creation & Type Annotations

// Uncommenting the following line would cause an error, since g is a Float, not a String
// g = "9"


// Fun with Numbers

// Underscores function as commas here. This is a valid way to express a number
var bankAccountBalance: Int = 1_000_000

let e: Float = 2.71828
let newYorkStateSalesTax: Float = 0.08875

// Boolean values, for expressing things that are either true or false
let isTired: Bool = true
